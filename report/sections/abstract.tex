This work presents the development of \textbf{Feed-Forward Neural Networks (FFNNs)} for \textbf{intrusion detection} using the \textbf{CICIDS2017} dataset.  
Through six progressive tasks, we address data cleaning, feature bias, class imbalance, architectural design, and overfitting control.  
The final model—a three-layer FFNN (128-64-32) with ReLU activation, AdamW optimization, and Batch Normalization—achieved \textbf{96\% accuracy} and \textbf{0.94 macro-F1}.  
Results highlight that bias mitigation, weighted loss optimization, and regularization are essential for reliable, generalizable \textbf{AI-based IDS} capable of detecting diverse network attacks in real-world cybersecurity contexts.
